# Case 1: Expected Output

## Test Scenario
This test case covers the edge case where **array item fields use bracket notation** which breaks path validation.

### Issue
- Field: `building.include = true`
- Problem: Missing required field `building.financials.insurers[0].insurer`
- The bracket notation `insurers[0].insurer` was causing `fieldExistsInSchema` to fail

### Expected Analysis Result

```json
{
  "analyses": [
    {
      "triggerField": "objects.insuredItem.0.products.building.include",
      "triggerValue": true,
      "triggerFieldLabel": "Building Coverage",
      "errorField": "objects.insuredItem.0.products.building.include",
      "errorFieldLabel": "Building Coverage",
      "errorFieldCurrentValue": true,
      "suggestions": [
        {
          "field": "objects.insuredItem.0.products.building.financials.insurers.0.insurer",
          "currentValue": "<not set>",
          "allowedValues": [
            "(a string)"
          ],
          "isRequired": true,
          "title": "Insurer"
        }
      ],
      "type": "dependency"
    }
  ],
  "missingInFlattenedSchema": []
}
```

## Key Points

✅ **No self-referencing suggestions** - Does NOT suggest changing `building.include` itself

✅ **Correct dependency detection** - Identifies this as a dependency error (type="dependency")

✅ **Suggests the actual missing field** - Points to `insurers.0.insurer` using dot notation

✅ **Human-readable title** - Shows "Insurer" instead of the full path

✅ **No missing fields** - The `insurer` field exists in the flattened schema

## What Was Fixed

Changed array item path format from bracket notation `insurers[0].insurer` to dot notation `insurers.0.insurer` so that `fieldExistsInSchema` can properly validate the path.
